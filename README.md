# Code.py

code.py is the implementation of exercise-1, it would execute CLI commands for different algorithms with different min-sup percentage and extract time taken information from the stdout and plot the graph for two input files (retail1.txt and retail2.txt)
`python3 code.py`

# Code2.py

code2.py is the implementation of exercise-2, it would excute CLI commands for different algorithms with different min-sup percentage and extract time taken information from the stdout and the number of itemset information from the output generated and shows the result in the tabular formate for the two input files retail1.txt and retail2.txt
`python3 code2.py`
